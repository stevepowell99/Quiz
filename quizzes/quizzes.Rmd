```

## üìö Good factor labels

Before taking the quiz below, watch this [short video]([https://vimeo.com/580212681](https://vimeo.com/580212681)) which explains what makes a good factor label or refer to these [Guide sections]([https://guide.causalmap.app/creating-good-factor-labels.html?q=good#creating-good-factor-labels](https://guide.causalmap.app/creating-good-factor-labels.html?q=good#creating-good-factor-labels)).

Hierarchical coding can also improve your factor labels, so check out this video or this [guide section](https://guide.causalmap.app/xhierarchical-coding.html?q=hierachica#xhierarchical-coding) for more information.

```{r labs}
make_quiz("4_factor_labels")
```


## 5: Advanced analysis{#xlevel5}

Welcome to level 5, advanced analysis!

These quizzes refer to the [Level 5](https://guide.causalmap.app/xlevel5.html) section of the Guide.

## üìö Tracing paths

Read up on <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/xrobustness.html?q=tracing#xrobustness" target="_blank">tracing paths</a>, 
<a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/xcontinuity.html" target="_blank">continuity and tracing threads</a> in the guide and then test your knowledge with the quiz below!


```{r tracing}
make_quiz("5_tracing")
```

## üìö Zooming

After reading this section on [hierarchical coding and zooming](https://guide.causalmap.app/xsimplifying-with-hierarchical.html) try this quiz.


```{r levels}
#help_drop("xsimplifying-with-hierarchical",label="Read about hierarchical coding")
make_quiz("5_levels")
```

## üìö Interpreting special hashtags



![](images/photo-1571570261702-3d23956fa32eixlib=rb-1.2.jpeg)

Like with any other kind of data analysis, in causal mapping you have to be careful to interpret your results correctly and that is what the next four quizzes will test you on. 

Have a read of [this Guide section](https://guide.causalmap.app/xinterpret.html).

You could also read up on [hashtags](https://guide.causalmap.app/xcoding-panel.html?q=hypoth#xhashtags).

This first quiz will test your knowledge on hashtags.

One thing to think about is, have you coded only explicit causal claims or have you also coded, for example:
‚Ä¢	hypothetical links
‚Ä¢	dreams / hopes / fears / wishes for the future
‚Ä¢	statements that something does NOT cause something else?



```{r interp}
#help_drop("xinterp",label="Read about interpreting maps")
#help_drop("xhashtags",label="Read about hashtags")
make_quiz("5_interp 1")
```

## üìö Interpreting opposites

Combining opposites is a useful and powerful way of dealing with ‚Äúnegative‚Äù factors that have ‚Äúpositive‚Äù counterparts. A ‚Äò~‚Äô can be used to signify a negative i.e. ‚Äò~good health‚Äô can be read as ‚Äòbad health‚Äô. This function is only useful if you are able to interpret your map after using it, so this quiz will test this.

Check out this [guide section](https://guide.causalmap.app/conditional-formats.html?q=condi#conditional-formats) before giving it a go.

```{r interp2}
make_quiz("5_interp 2")
```

## üìö Interpreting source IDs 

There are quite a few potential pitfalls to interpreting causal maps! One of them is the [transitivity trap](https://guide.causalmap.app/xtransitivity-trap.html), so have a read of that section of the Guide.

![](https://guide.causalmap.app/_assets/giphy.gif)


Often on maps you will see the number of sources who mentioned the link written just above the link. Read [this section](https://guide.causalmap.app/conditional-formats.html?q=label%20#xformatting-links) of the guide to learn how to label your links. As the section on the [transitivity trap](https://guide.causalmap.app/xtransitivity-trap.html) explains it is important to understand that it may not be the same respondents reporting the entire causal claim, so you must be careful when interpreting source counts.


In these questions, you can assume

- all links have been encoded as normal causal claims, not for example as hypotheses or dreams or plans
- any numbers printed on the links are numbers of citations (quotes)

For each map, pick the best interpretation(s)



```{r interp3}
make_quiz("5_interp 3")
```

## üìö Interpreting continuity

This quiz continues looking at avoiding the transitivity trap. By using the tracing threads filter after tracing robustness or tracing paths, you can visualise how many sources reported an entire chain of causal claims. Read this [section of the guide](https://guide.causalmap.app/xcontinuity.html?q=trace#xtracing-threads) for more information.

```{r interp4}
make_quiz("5_interp 4")
```

## üìö Interpreting 'surprise'

By using the `surprise` filter, you can split your links into bundles for specific groups like women and men, and visualise whether the sources within a group mentioned the link surprisingly frequently or infrequently. Read this [section of the guide](https://guide.causalmap.app/comparing.html#xsurprise) for more information.

```{r surp}
make_quiz("5_surprise")
```

## üíª Conditional formats

Conditional formats calculate and visualise information in your map, making your map easier to interpret.

Check out this [guide section](https://guide.causalmap.app/coding-opposites.html?q=oppo#combining-opposites) before giving it a go.

```{r conditional}
make_quiz("5_conditional formats")
```

## üíª Advanced tips

Experts know all the short-cuts to make life quicker and simpler. Are you an expert?

```{r tips}
make_quiz("5_random")
```
