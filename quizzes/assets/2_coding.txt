Which of these is the clearest example of a causal claim?
I added the butter and then added the nuts
She wants to earn more money
y The house fell down due to the earthquake

Which of these is the clearest example of a causal claim?
1+1=2
y Using the learning hub is helping me understand Causal Map better
y I was sad because I had lost my money
There are seven continents

When you are deciding what factor labels to use, which is the best advice?
You should always make sure each label captures all the detail of the original statement
You should only use existing factor labels
y Use existing factor labels where possible

When you are deciding what factor labels to use, which is the best advice?
Once you have created a factor label, you should not change it
y It is normal to tweak the labels from time to time to reflect new uses of the factor

How would you code 'The house fell down due to the earthquake'
y The earthquake happened --> The house fell down
The house fell down --> The earthquake happened
(It is not possible to code this causally)

What is wrong with this causal link: All the under-18s were vaccinated AND all the over-18s were vaccinated --> Everyone was vaccinated
y This is a logical connection, not a causal one
These things could have happened at different times

What is tricky about this causal claim: The intervention (schools projects in Cheshire) --> The outcome: (The programme contributes to democratic behaviour)
y The outcome, the consequence factor, is itself a causal claim
These things could have happened at different times
We should not use words like 'outcome' in causal mapping

Compare these two factor labels: `Speeches are monitored` and `Activists monitor political speeches`. What do you think?
y The first one is better if you have many different claims about monitoring and you don't care who does it or what the speeches are about
The first one is wrong because you should never use a passive verb in a factor label
y The second one is more precise
y The first one might be easier to match up with other factors in your dataset

What is wrong with this causal claim: Listening skills --> Good management
y This is probably a logical connection (listening skills are part of good management) so don't code it like this
Causal factor labels should always have verbs to show who is doing what
