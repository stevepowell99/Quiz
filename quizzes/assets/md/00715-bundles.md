# The Bundles Table{#xthe-bundles-table}

This table is like the links table, but each row represents one *bundle* of links with the same influence and consequence factors. 

### Fields

- `from_label_`. 
- `to_label`. 
- `simple_bundle`.

The other columns show counts, the number of unique values of each field in the links table.
