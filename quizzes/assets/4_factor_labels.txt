Which of the following are good tips for writing good factor labels?
y Make sure labels are easy to understand even without a lot of context
y Ensure labels are concise
y Use labels that you can reuse throughout your data set
Write long, unique factor labels

"I learned about cooking at a course at the local college so now my cooking skills have improved". If the consequence factor is "cooking skills improved", what would make a good influence factor?
y "Attended course at local college"
"I learned about cooking at the local college"
hint The influence and consequence factors should be logically independent of one another and not overlap in meaning. If you say you learned something, that might already *mean* that your skills improved.

"(A) All the boys and all the girls have been vaccinated, so now (B) all the children are vaccinated". Can you code this as a causal link between (A) and (B), remembering that the influence and consequence factors should be logically independent of one another and not overlap in meaning? 
y no
yes
maybe
hint The influence and consequence factors should be logically independent of one another and not overlap in meaning.

Hierarchical coding allows you to do the following:
Format your factor labels so they are across several lines
y Create nested factors so by ‘zooming in and out’ you can choose how much detail to display in your map
Mark “negative” factors as such, allowing them to be treated as the opposite of their positive counterpart
y Organise your causal factors into groups, in such a way that the individual factors in a group can be thought of as different aspects of a higher-level causal factor or idea

Read this statement: “I have started up a new business, selling salted fish which has been great, we are getting a lot of money from it.” Which of the following factor labels are the best option?

y New business; Selling salted fish --> Income

Read this statement: “With everyone wearing a mask due to Covid meant I found it harder to communicate with people, as I could not lip read” Which of the following factor labels are the best option? Remembering that `~` indicates a contrary factor.
Everyone wearing a mask due to Covid --> harder to communicate with people, as I could not lip read
y Covid restrictions; Masks --> ~Communication; Ability to lip read
Wearing masks in Covid --> Poor communication as could not lip read
hint Don't create factors which themselves express a causal connection (avoid words like `as` or `because`).
