It quotes the same text again which you previously quoted
It chains a new link after the old one
It makes the claim globally valid

y Click on the Statements tab and use the table filters to filter by source_id
Click on the Links tab and use the table filters to filter by source_id

What should you consider when creating a factor label?
Make your labels factor in as much detail as possible
y Keep your factor labels brief
y Make sure you have the appropriate context

How can you get an overview of all the links coded for the current source?
Click the black "book" icon icon:book;
Click the green "book" icon icon:book;
Click on the Statements tab and use the table filters to filter by source_id
y Click on the Links tab and use the table filters to filter by source_id

How can you code question by question rather than statement by statement (e.g. code all the answers to question 1 first, then all the answers to question 2)?
Click the black "book" icon icon:book;
Click the green "book" icon icon:book;
y Click on the Statements tab (probably best to show `All` entries), filter by question_id, then click on the statement you want to code
Click on the Links tab, filter by question_id, then click on the statement you want to code

How would you code 'I got more money from sales of milk and also from selling my chickens'
y I would put two factors 'selling milk' and 'selling chickens' in the first box and 'got more money' in the second because it is quicker
I would code this twice, once from 'selling milk' to 'got more money' and once from 'selling chickens' to 'got more money' because it is more precise

If you have a factor like `~Health behaviour; smoking` already in a factor dropdown when coding, how can you "flip" it to its opposite (`Health behaviour; ~smoking`)?
You can't
y Click the icon with two opposing arrows icon:exchange above the factor dropdown
Click the globe icon icon:globe

If you want to construct a factor like `Health behaviour; eating fruit` in a factor dropdown when coding, and you have already coded the higher-level factor `Health behaviour`, how can you do this quickly?
You can't
You can, but you have to type everything: `Health behaviour; eating fruit`
y First select the higher-level factor `Health behaviour` and then just type `; eating fruit` directly after it

Use the special symbol `%%`
Click the icon with two opposing arrows icon:exchange above the dropdown
Click the globe icon icon:globe

If you have already used `Health behaviour; eating fruit` while coding, but you have never used `Health behaviour` alone:
y Both `Health behaviour` and `Health behaviour; eating fruit` will appear in the factor dropdowns when coding
`Health behaviour; eating fruit` will appear in the factor dropdowns when coding, but `Health behaviour` will not
`~Health behaviour; eating fruit` will appear in the factor dropdowns when coding, but `Health behaviour` will not
