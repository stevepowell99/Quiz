Read this hierarchical factor label ///‘Organisation X; Agricultural input; New water pump’. ///If the zoom level is set to 2 what will you see?
Organisation X; Agricultural input; New water pump
y Organisation X; Agricultural input
Organisation X

Read this hierarchical factor label ///‘Organisation X; Social cash transfer; Women only’. ///If the zoom level is set to 1 what will you see?
Organisation X; Social cash transfer; Women only
Organisation X; Social cash transfer
y Organisation X 

Looking at the same factor label what would happen if the zoom level was set to 4? 
It would disappear
y It would appear in its full form, unchanged
You would not be able to set the zoom level to 4 as there are only 3 levels to this factor

What would happen if the two factor labels mentioned above: ///‘Organisation X; Social cash transfer; Women only’ ///and ///‘Organisation X; Agricultural input; New water pump’ ///were on the same map and the zoom level was set to 1?
There would be two identical factor labels
y They would be rolled into one factor label, so you would only see one 
Nothing, both factor labels would stay the same
